# Creation of low resolution vehicle dataset

This project enables the extraction of image crops containing low resolution vehicles from video frames. The image extraction is performed using openCV flow detection and tracking. 

To extract the images execute dataset_creation.py. The images obtained have been manually filtered and stored in dais_dataset.tar.gz files.
